      <p>Manchester City have jumped into top spot in the Premier League table with a win over Everton after Liverpool were held by West Ham on Monday.

Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick as Man City beat Arsenal on Sunday to close the gap on Liverpool, and Jurgen Klopp's leaders duly drew 1-1 at West Ham - their second draw in as many games.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer won his ninth match out of 10 matches as Manchester United boss, with an early Marcus Rashford goal the difference as they edged a 1-0 win at Leicester City on Sunday.

Tottenham and the Magpies kicked off the weekend's action at Wembley on Saturday lunchtime, with Heung-min Son's late goal earning a 1-0 win to keep Spurs firmly in the title race discussion.</p>
Chelsea put their 4-0 loss to Bournemouth behind them as they thrashed Huddersfield 5-0 at Stamford Bridge, while Michy Batshuayi made an impact as a late substitute for Crystal Palace as the Eagles beat Fulham 2-0.

And Man City completed their double-match gameweek with a victory at Goodison Park to move above Jurgen Klopp's side on goal difference.
